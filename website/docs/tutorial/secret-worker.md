# Trusting Tasks to Workers

Trust is the most convenient force in the universe.
Trust allows us to ignore all of the details of *how* an agent does something and focus just on *what* it does.
Trust erases the internal details, leaving only the interface: if you make a request, you will always get the expected response.
So easy!

Ideally, trust would be universal and everything could be smooth and simple, but the difficulty is always in establishing trust in the first place.
Fortunately, through the identity framework and the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs), Escrin makes establishing trust in Smart Workers simple.
Escrin is largely a framework for establishing programmatic trust.
